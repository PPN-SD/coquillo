# Coquillo 2.0
This is the all-new Coquillo. After years of hibernation, it has been updated for the modern day. The codebase is completely new and written atop Qt 5.

## Notable Changes
- Much more refined UI.
- Improved automatic track numbering.
- CDDB search replaced with MusicBrainz.
- Read-only support for ALL tags contained in a file.

## Known Issues
- Wayland support might not be complete in all environments. E.g. icons might not follow your theme or load at all.
- If files initially contain images in multiple tags, all images will be moved to one tag only when written again.

## The Future
This release will hopefully be followed by a few bugfix releases if necessary. Otherwise I am undecided how to proced. Having switched to Gnome years ago and given the divergence of GTK from 'generic desktop feel', Coquillo might one day be ported to the GTK toolkit.

## Packages
Official packages for Coquillo can be found for Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, OpenSuse and Ubuntu.

1. [Arch Linux (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/coquillo)
2. [Other distributions (OpenSUSE Build Service)](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Asjuvonen&package=coquillo)

Also, an unofficial legacy release for OS/2 still seems to exist:
