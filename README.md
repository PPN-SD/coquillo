# Coquillo 2.0
This is the all-new Coquillo. After years of hibernation, it has been updated for the modern day. The codebase is completely new and written atop Qt 5.

## Notable Changes
- Much more refined UI.
- Improved automatic track numbering.
- CDDB search makes room for MusicBrainz.
- Read-only support for ALL tags contained in a file.

## The Future
This release will hopefully receive a few bugfix releases if necessary. Otherwise I am undecided how to proced. Having switched to Gnome years ago and given the divergence of GTK from 'generic desktop feel', Coquillo might one day be ported to the GTK toolkit.
