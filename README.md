# Coquillo 2
This repo now contains work-in-progress code of the upcoming Qt 5 version of 
reworked Coquillo. Some things work and some don't and you probably don't want
to think about using this version on a daily basis as of now. Check coquillo-qt4
branch for the latest snaphot of old Coquillo, which should be more usable.

You can always check the Qt-apps.org page for stable releases aswell as binary
packages for your distro.

All code in this repo is released under GPLv3 (because Qt is). Pre-built binary
libraries follow the license of the original libraries. Coquillo's official
palm tree logo is licensed privately and you cannot use it as-is in your
projects (derived of my code or not) but you can freely use it as a basis for
your own graphics if it's modified to be visually "enough different".
